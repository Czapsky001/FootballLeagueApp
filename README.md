# FootballLeagueApp
At the beginning I created a model which I needed, then I connected to database.
At frontend I created login and registration form
I made some shape of website to make it readable
At the end I implement more controllers at backend then connect it to frontend. 

Future:
edit profile, notification system, table and results from more than one league
