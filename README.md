# FootballLeagueApp_RbIt
At the beginning I created model that i needed then connect to database.
I created controllers and implement jwt token for authorization.
On frontent I created login and register form and authcontext for authorization.
Styled page a little.
At the end I implement more controllers on backend then connect it on frontent.

Future:
edit profile, notification system, table and results from more than one league
